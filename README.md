# AI-Powered-Code-Auto-Completion-and-Bug-Prediction-System

n intelligent code assistant that leverages AI and machine learning to provide real-time code suggestions, predict bugs before they occur, and assist developers in writing clean and optimized code. This full-stack application is built with **Java (Spring Boot)** for the backend and **React.js** for the frontend, with a **SQL database** for bug tracking and code storage.

## ✨ Features

- ⚡ **Real-time Code Auto-Completion** using AI/NLP
- 🐞 **Bug Prediction Engine** to identify potential errors during coding
- 📊 **SQL-backed bug tracker** to manage and log historical bug data
- 🔗 **Spring Boot REST API** for backend processing
- 🌐 **React-based User Interface** for seamless developer experience
- 🧠 **Deep Learning Model Integration** for code analysis
- 💡 Supports multi-language syntax (extendable)
